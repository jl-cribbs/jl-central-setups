# jl-central-setups
A page usable by anyone across JL for branch setups.

The intended function for this is to use the webpage (-) to navigate to the appropriate utilities.
By using a Github page, the system does not need to be updated by every branch individually, on every PC individual; updates can be rolled out central and will be immediately functional for all users.
